# my-p5js-sketches
A repo containing all of my p5js sketches

For sketch development, I run all sketches on node.js http-server.
1) Install node.js
2) npm install -g http-server
3) run server by going to folder that has the files you want to server and typing 'http-server'
4) point browser to http://localhost:8080/
