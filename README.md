# my-p5js-sketches
A repo containing all of my p5js sketches

For sketch development, I run all sketches on node.js browser-sync
Original directions found at: https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server
Browser sync automatically reloads page when code has been modified! Nice!
1) Install node.js
2) npm install -g browser-sync
3) run server by going to folder that has the files you want to server and typing
    browser-sync start --server -f w
4) point browser to http://localhost:3000
