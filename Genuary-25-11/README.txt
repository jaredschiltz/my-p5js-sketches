Impossible day - Try to do something that feels impossible for
you to do. Maybe it is impossible. Maybe it’s too ambitious.
Maybe it’s something you know nothing about how to accomplish.

I want to do vector graphics warping in code. I've read many technical papers on 
image warping and understand the math behind the transformations. Raster image 
processing is a simple pixel by pixel operation. To warp vectors, each vector 
shape must be split into vertices, and each of these must be transformed. Anyway, 
I spent a signficant amount of time on this and have nothing to show for it. This
is going to take a signficant amount of work. I know this kind of thing is possible, 
because Affinity Designer can do it (see the picture).
